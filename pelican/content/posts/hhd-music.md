I sing with the [Brooklyn Community Chorus](https://brooklyncommunitychorus.org/) and we sometimes hold our concerts at [Congregation Beth Elohim](https://cbebk.org/) in Park Slope. In return, CBE invites us to provide backup vocals during their High Holy Days services. I participated in 2019 and was pleased to receive a binder full of music, some of which was handwritten, heavily annotated, or used a different melody in rehearsal. To produce sheet music from these pages, I turned to [Lilypond](http://lilypond.org/), a text-based music editor. In a few weeks Iâ€™d taught myself enough to transcribe 15 pages of music. The source files and PDF output are available [on Github](https://github.com/christalee/hhd-music).
