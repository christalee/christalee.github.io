Welcome! I'm a STEM/maker educator, looking for work in data science/engineering or a role that takes advantage of my technical fluency, communication skills, and attention to detail (e.g. project manager, QA/testing, technical writer, or junior software dev). I'm also open to hardware prototyping and fabrication work. Find out more below or get in touch!
