<h1>Intro to Sensors</h1>
<img src="sensors_cover.jpg" width=500px />
<h3>Class Information</h3>
<p><strong>Format:</strong> 2 weekday evening sessions, 2 hours each</p>
<p><strong>Most Recently Taught:</strong> July 18 & 25, 2012</p>
<p><strong>Instructors:</strong> Christalee Bieber & Daniel Bergey</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> Sensors help us hear what the world around us has to say.  In this class you will build circuits that measure temperature, light, and motion.  We will cover voltage and current control, and use transistors and op-amps (amplifiers) to drive LEDs and lightbulbs.  Our examples will all be analog, but the techniques are also useful for connecting sensors to microcontrollers.</p>

<p>Bring your own project ideas, or use ours to start.  Each session will have time to work on your project with help from instructors.  No electronics background is required.  All ages welcome; students 13 and under should be accompanied by an adult.</p>

<h3>Learning Objectives</h3>
<p>Upon completing this course, students should be capable of:</p>
<ul>
<li>designing & analyzing circuits containing sensor elements</li>
<li>finding key information on electronic components' datasheets</li>
<li>using transistors and op-amps to control voltage and current in sensor circuits</li>
<li>reading circuit schematics & resistor values</li>
<li>building example circuits on breadboards</li>
</ul>

<h3>Reflections</h3>

<p>Class 1</p>
<ol>
<li>If possible, the introductory remarks should include pictures or videos of the example projects, for best inspiration.</li>
<li>We asked students about their background: everyone had built a circuit, nearly everyone had done some programming, but few had microcontroller experience (combining programming with electronics). We meant to ask who knew how to use a breadboard, but forgot.</li>
<li>Accordingly, we breezed through the first page of the handout. We had them build circuit 1a just to get their hands on the batteries and lamps, and break up the lecturing.  It turned out that almost no one had used a breadboard.  We should have talked more about how breadboards worked before going on to add-a-switch.</li>
<li>It might also work well to provide a picture of 2a or 2b laid out on a breadboard, and encourage students to lay out their components the same way.</li>
<li>Contrary to our careful warning about picking a sensor that responds to the correct range, it was very challenging to produce a detectable signal from the thermistors. Our students were willing to try applying ice and flame, but it didn't always work and was ultimately somewhat frustrating.</li>
</ol>

<p>Class 2</p>
<ol>
<li>In the documents above, all the circuit diagrams were provided to the students in class 1, and students worked through them at their own pace during the hands-on sections. **</li>
<li>Students wanted more help breadboarding the most complex circuits, especially the comparator in Fig. 3d. We provided a pre-built example, but a live demo or a series of photos breaking the process into steps might help more.</li>
</ol>

<p>General Course Design</p>
<ol>
<li>Example circuits and transistor & op-amp concepts were developed with reference to the following text, particularly Chapters 2 and 4.
<blockquote>Horowitz, Paul, and Winfield Hill. <em>The Art of Electronics.</em> 2nd ed. Cambridge University Press, 1989. ISBN: 978-0521370950.</blockquote></li>
<li>Before teaching the class, our learning objectives contained more emphasis on design concepts and mathematical analysis of sensor circuits. In class, these topics were skipped or not sufficiently emphasized due to time constraints.</li>
<li>Perhaps we should've designed the class around a weather-station project, or an accelerometer or GPS app. We wanted to avoid the complications of teaching digital circuits and/or the Arduino environment, so we chose this very low-level, analog set of examples. An audience already familiar with those concepts, however, might appreciate a more packaged take-home.</li>
<li>We anticipate re-teaching this seminar after establishing a Introductory Circuits class, where students can learn the basic voltage, current, component identification, and breadboarding skills used in this course. While we were (and remain) willing to include those topics in this course, students who encounter them for the first time are not well-positioned to absorb the sensors content as well, and may become frustrated.</li>
<li>While we allowed younger students to attend, it is not aimed at that audience. Revisions I would consider for a school-age audience: replace some circuit-building time with instructor demonstrations; definitely pick a simple example project they can take home (slider or tilt switch + lights? something wearable?); ***</li>
<li>We salvaged several different types of switches from the stockroom, and ***</li>
