Inspired by the hilarious interview question, "What words would your family use to describe you?"

My cats would describe me as warm and dedicated to their welfare, although they have concerns about my emergency response times.

My senior cat reports high levels of satisfaction with his automatic food delivery service, which boasts 24/7 uptime and limits access to authorized users. Prior to this, feeding the cat involved manual operation of the food container, requiring round-the-clock staffing. I researched and implemented this solution after consulting with major stakeholders, including my partner and my sleep schedule.

My junior cat has ongoing concerns about my commitment to user satisfaction, given my frequent attempts to rub her tummy and shoo her off the counter, but concedes that I fulfill my role of Second-Best Human adequately.
