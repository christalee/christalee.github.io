[Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) is an annual challenge during the month of December, posing short puzzles that generally require code to solve. Although I've never seriously competed, I have completed for my own enjoyment every puzzle from 2016, and nearly every one from 2015. The solutions from 2016 are annotated for potential teaching use, as well as showing off my problem-solving skills. Some 2015 solutions include type hinting via [mypy](https://mypy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html), an approach I later abandoned. The solutions and corresponding test suites are [available on Github](https://github.com/christalee/AoC).
