      <p>Colleagues often consult me for advice on teaching programming as fledgling or non-programmers. Here are capsule reviews of various tools and approaches for beginners.</p>
<h3>Philosophy</h3>
<p>When picking a platform/curriculum for programming, I focus on these criteria:</p>
<ul>
<li>how familiar or easy to learn it is for the instructor</li>
<li>how aligned it is to pre-existing student interests (games, fan/professional/personal webpage, mobile app, robots - all popular)</li>
<li>whether you want to teach programming in a job context ('learn to make a webpage'), or as a medium for student work on other topics ('use Twine/Scratch to tell a story about...')</li>
</ul>
<p>My colleagues teach with 1:1 Chromebooks, so they need tools that keep student work in the browser (look out for older tools that use Flash). You know your students best - how well do they type? proofread? read directions (vs. video or interactive hints)? If they are aiming at careers in programming (or other STEM), definitely plan opportunities for "real coding"; but if not, it may be more frustrating than rewarding.</p>
<p>If you want a crash course in CS pedagogy, "computational thinking" is the keyword, but it isn't necessary unless you're looking for some organizing principles/vocabulary.</p>
<!-- (I wrote more about computational thinking here.) -->

<h3>Stuff I've Done</h3>
<p>To give you a concrete idea of where I'm coming from, here are CS activities I taught or facilitated with colleagues:</p>
<ul>
<li>basic programming in <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/">Scratch</a>, up through loops and variables (8 weeks)</li>
<li>basic HTML/CSS -&gt; build a webpage in <a href="https://www.weebly.com/">Weebly</a></li>
<li>students building Android apps in <a href="http://appinventor.mit.edu/explore/">App Inventor</a></li>
<li>students exploring game dev with <a href="https://unity3d.com/">Unity 3D</a></li>
<li>student writing a Python app to display assignment due dates in the classroom, based on the teacher's updated Google Calendar (using OAuth &amp; RasPi)</li>
<li>students exploring basic programming with <a href="https://www.codecademy.com/">Codecademy</a>, <a href="https://code.org/">Code.org</a>, and <a href="https://codecombat.com/">CodeCombat</a></li>
<li>"dissecting" a broken iMac &amp; other electronics</li>
</ul>
<h3>Making a Webpage</h3>
<p><a href="https://thimble.mozilla.org/en-US/">Mozilla Thimble</a> is the most friendly <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/thimble.mozilla.org/wiki/Using-Thimble-FAQ">webpage editor/remixer</a> I know of. You can write your template "from scratch" and include directions as a tutorial, then publish and send the link to students to remix. Downsides: students might have to make an account; everything will be licensed attribution-only, so this isn't a good platform if students want to use lots of other people's copyrighted photos, etc. (If it's all their own writing and images, or they get permission &amp; give credit, great!)</p>
<p><a href="https://www.weebly.com/">Weebly</a> is also popular. Its main mode is drag-and-drop, though you might be able to dig into themes and options to work with the raw HTML.</p>
<p>I haven't used <a href="https://codepen.io/">codepen.io</a> specifically, but it looks like a decent online web dev editor. You would have to find or write lessons.</p>
<p>The easiest and cheapest option for hosting might be to keep webpages and assets in a public Google Drive folder. If you create in Thimble, you can download instead of publishing; if you'd rather use a different editor, Caret is good, and can save directly to Drive on Chromebooks. If this is meant to be a homepage students can use and update in the future, having it in their Google Drive sounds better than on another site/account they will forget about once the project is over.</p>
<h3>Graphics, Animations</h3>
<p>For students new to coding who might not be sure what aspects of programming appeal to them most, I tend to go with Scratch; the floor is low, the community/knowledge base is very robust, and since you can define variables and functions, the ceiling is pretty high. It's the simplest way to get interactive/animated graphics and music, which many students consider important to making games. And students familiar with the block environment can move on to Android apps with App Inventor.</p>
<p>For reference, here is a set of Scratch activities I used in a <a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0BxkPVQhGc8zXREhxYVJfbTh5aEk?usp=sharing">freshmen programming elective</a>.</p>
<p>I've been interested in Twine but haven't used it with students. My plan was always to focus on storytelling, with the HTML/CSS being enrichment. If you decide to go with Twine, I am super curious to hear how it goes!</p>
<h3>Other Popular Tools</h3>
<p>I've only used Code.org's classic <a href="https://studio.code.org/hoc/1">Hour of Code</a> as a Day 1/Week 1 intro to block programming. I see tutorials there from other familiar resources:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.codecademy.com/">Codecademy</a> - scaffolded tutorials on many subjects for a general adult audience; not good for students who don't read or process directions well</p>
<p><a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-programming">Khan Academy</a> - not as polished as CodeCademy or Code.org, but if you use Khan for other topics, maybe stick with it!</p>
<p><a href="https://codecombat.com/">CodeCombat</a> - Python or Javascript, framed as a hero quest RPG; silly, but ok for self-study</p>
<p><a href="https://blockly.games/">Blockly Games</a> - a self-contained online curriculum with a ramp from blocks to text editor, maybe short on guidance for self-study but should be fine in the classroom</p>
